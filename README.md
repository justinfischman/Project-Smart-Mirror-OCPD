Project Smart Mirror
Group Members: Justin Fischman, Jeff Kelsch, Muskan Sharma
 
Overview - The smart mirror is meant to help people with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder. To do so, the mirror can display        information that a person may use throughout their day. This includes calendar events, news updates, weather and more. The mirror is also connected to Google Assistant to allow the user to ask questions and add calendar events. The goal of this product is to allow someone with OCPD to begin their day without stress as this is the biggest part of having OCPD - being stressed about perfection. 

Phase 1 - During the research stage, everyone in the group looked up what OCPD was and how it affects the people who have it. When we finished researching, we decided on a product which best fit all of the needs of a person with OCPD that we found. These requirements inluded namely an ergonomic design and an aesthetically pleasing look.

Phase 2 - For prototyping, we made small models of what the frame of the mirror would look like. Along with this we made sketchup files detailing the dimensions of the prototype. The materials we used include balsa wood, a car mirror, tape, and glue. Along with this, we began to work with the Google Assistant API to allow the user to work with Google.

Phase 3 - The material for assembling the project included wood (planks and crown molding), wood glue, a raspberry pi, a monitor, a speaker, and a two way mirror. To assemble this project, we started with the frame. To make the frame, we worked with the tools in the FabLab in order to cut the wood. Along with this, we finished implementing the necessary software to get the mirror to work and show up to the user. Finally, we fit everything into place and completed it.

Phase 4 - To test, we turned on the monitor thorugh the mirror and made sure everyhting was correct. Along with this, we made sure the google assistant could answer questions and make events on start-up.
